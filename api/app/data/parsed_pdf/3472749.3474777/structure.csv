The gap between simple tab-based browser interfaces and the complexity of users’ tasks can lead to serious ad- verse effects – commonly referred to as “tab overload.” This paper introduces a Chrome extension called Tabs.do, which explores bringing a task-centric approach to the browser, helping users to group their tabs into tasks and then organize, prioritize, and switch between those tasks fluidly. To lower the cost of importing, Tabs.do uses machine learning to make intelligent suggestions for grouping users’ open tabs into task bundles by exploiting behavioral and semantic features. We conducted a field deployment study where participants used Tabs.do with their real-life tasks in the wild, and showed that Tabs.do can decrease tab clutter, enabled users to create rich task structures with lightweight interactions, and allowed participants to context-switch among tasks more efficiently.",0.08416830065359478,0.29839002525252517,0.48266635074395414,0.484560606060606,,

For example, users keep tabs open so they can resume progress on their tasks but cannot easily switch focus between sets of tabs for their different tasks; as reminders that quickly lose reminding value as they pile up; as reading lists of items that are never actually read and result in clutter; and as manifestations of their mental models that are artificially forced",0.5191683006535948,0.6464035353535353,0.9178218017254904,0.8237676767676767,,

Our work builds on this observation that users often open multiple tabs to support the same task, and provides mechanisms for users to group them together as task bundles. More recently, Bento Browser [29] explored a search- centric mobile browser that scaffolds users search tasks by treating all search results as opened or unopened tabs. In the current work, we also exploit users’ search activities to scaffold their task struc- tures. However, instead of forcing tabs opened from a search results to be grouped together, Tabs.do uses a machine learning model that considers search activities and other behavioral and semantic features at the same time to produce tab grouping suggestions. This allows Tabs.do to produce grouping suggestions for tabs not opened from search results, and allows users to make adjustments to the grouping suggestions to better fit their mental models and correct mistakes made by the model. Most directly related to this current work is a recent interview and survey study that investigated tab management issues users face today [13]. At a high level, one of the main observations was that users need support managing their tabs based on the tasks they were conducting [13]. In the current work, we explore taking a task-centric approach to tab management by allowing users to group their tabs and save them into the system as tab bundles. The system, in turn, provides affordances to manage them as tasks. For example, users can also group their tabs into tasks and subtasks to better reflect their mental models, context-switch between their tasks or subtasks more efficiently.",0.5189918300653594,0.10063333333333331,0.9178322460653595,0.44404166666666667,,

Early systems focused on building workspaces for the desktop environment [2, 3, 31, 54], for example allowing users to group application windows by different virtual desktops and switch among them [31], organize files and application shortcuts in a 3D desktop environment [3], or create integrated workspaces by group- ing application windows, files, and contacts for knowledge work [54]. In the current work, we build on ideas from prior research in activity-based computing, but focus on the important yet relatively unexplored context of managing browser tabs and its unique re- search challenges. Specifically, tasks in the browser are often more ad hoc, uncertain, and ephemeral than the traditional projects and desktop applications that prior systems have targeted [13, 38], re- flecting that users are exploring and sampling items from a nearly infinite space for a myriad of purposes in addition to keeping track of a finite set of their own documents. This fundamental difference introduces challenges such as allowing for fluid task structures that can support externalizing small tasks of uncertain importance that can later become full-fledged projects once explored more deeply [38], prioritizing and reminding users of their previously suspended tasks to avoid a black hole effect often associated with bookmark- ing [13], and de-prioritizing low importance tasks to avoid clutter while coping with users’ aspiration to collect and process too much information [13].",0.5189918300653594,0.5157431818181818,0.9178328331294117,0.8729886363636364,,

Since email tasks are by nature collaborative (i.e., receiving and delegating work with others), many prior systems focused on deadline management, communication, and coordination with others in business settings. In this current work, we also assume that tabs are often seen as tasks by users in both personal and professional scenarios and explore a task-centric approach to managing them.

Tab bundles have a variety of task functionality as described below. When containing one tab, the bundle is displayed and acts like a single tab (Figure 2 D), though it supports the same set of task functionality as when it is shown as a to-do. However, a tab bundle becomes particularly useful when it contains multiple tabs (Figure 2 E), at which point the entire bundle can be treated as a single task, and can be assigned a priority, scheduled (Figure 4), moved into a project (Figure 1), or otherwise managed as a task.

We randomly sampled 80% of labeled data for training, 10% for validation to prevent over-fitting, and 10% for testing model accuracy.

We further compared the labeling accuracy for using only semantic features versus only behavioral data. Results showed that the model trained on semantic features (1 through 5) had a labeling accuracy of 76.3%, and the model trained on behavioral features (6 through 8) had a labeling accuracy of 86.4%. This result suggests that both semantic and behavioral features contributed to the higher accuracy of the model trained on all features. To reduce model complexity and improve runtime efficiency, we iterated through different feature combinations to see if we can use only a subset of features and achieve similar performance to the complete model.

The posts were brief and asked for participants who have ever “ felt overwhelmed by their browser tabs .” The posts also contained a link to an online screener survey to recruit participants who used Chrome or Edge as their primary browsers which were the two browsers that we tested during development. Each participant was interviewed remotely before using Tabs.do and after using it via a video conferencing service that supported screen sharing. The pre- interviews lasted around 20 minutes which covered collecting their consent and demographic information, a brief walk-through of the interface, and installing the extension on their personal computers. We then scheduled each participant for a 30 minute post-interview approximately one week after installation, determined by their avail- ability. During the post-interviews, participants shared their screen and performed a retrospective walk-through of their usage of the system. All 10 participants completed the study and were each com- pensated a 50 USD Amazon gift card for their time.

Using a deep learning model, Tabs.do minimizes the cognitive and interaction costs of creating tab bun- dles, lowering the adoption barrier to our task-centric approach. Through a week-long field deployment study with 10 participants using Tabs.do on their computers to manage their real-world tabs, we found evidence that our task-centric approach allowed users to manage their browser tabs more effectively. Specifically, Tabs.do enabled participants to efficiently context-switch among tasks, re- duce tab clutter, and create task structures that better reflected their mental models. As online tasks become increasingly complex, new interfaces and interactions that can bridge the divide between tab management and task management in the browser may become increasingly important.
