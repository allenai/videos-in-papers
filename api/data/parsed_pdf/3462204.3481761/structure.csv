Online discussions that span diverse agendas can help readers mitigate the biased influences from news media. However, displaying comments based on popular voting often fails to reveal such diversities to readers. In this paper, we de- signed a proof-of-concept Hagendas that aims to improve awareness of divergent agendas in online news discussions. It presents possi- ble agendas automatically derived from news articles, and enables readers to view and filter the comments accordingly. We evaluated how Hagendas would affect users‚Äô online news discussion practices through a within-subjects experiment with 95 online participants from MTurk. While the agenda tags and filtering features did not significantly increase the number of distinct agendas people iden- tified through reading comments, 77.9% of participants preferred having those features for exploring online news discussion.",0.08736437908496732,0.31260593699495,0.4829458250875818,0.5506870848484848,,

In this paper, we denote such topics of comments as ‚Äòagendas‚Äô. However, the current ways of displaying news-related comments in social media are not supportive for users to stay aware of divergent agendas of comments shared by the public [13, 14]. The vast amount of comments under a thread are often presented in an ordered fashion such as recency or popularity ( e.g., ‚ÄòBest‚Äô, ‚ÄòTop‚Äô sorting in Reddit). While such display methods could help screen out low-quality comments, it holds a drawback that comments with relatively less popular but valuable agendas would not be easily visible to the public [24]. In addition, those whose perspective is seemingly different from that of the majority as revealed in the popular comments may hesitate to speak out (a.k.a. the spiral of silence [22, 32]), which could further discourage sharing comments with divergent subjects.",0.5189918300653594,0.3318115797979798,0.912481665882353,0.5506870848484848,,

One stream of research focused on organizing comments by their contents in dichotomous settings [14, 17, 21]. This, however, is not sufficient in the context of news because not every discussion falls into a bilateral setting. Other work attempted to summarize the contents of large- scale threaded comments through a text analytic visualization ( e.g., Sankey diagram [15, 16]) to show their topic distributions. Although these tools are effective means to encapsulate existing subjects in the comments, they still leave out any related agendas that have never been voiced out in the discussion. Little work has studied how to let readers aware of unvoiced topics from comments in online news discussions.",0.5195343137254902,0.553202993939394,0.914567657819608,0.7305683979797979,,
