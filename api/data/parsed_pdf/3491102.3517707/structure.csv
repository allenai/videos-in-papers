However, it remains unclear how HCI researchers preregister studies and what preregistration users perceive as benefits and challenges. By sys- tematically reviewing the past four CHI proceedings and surveying 11 researchers, we found that only 1.11% of papers presented prereg- istered studies, though both authors and reviewers of preregistered studies perceive it as beneficial. Our formative studies revealed key challenges ranging from a lack of detail about the study design, hindering comprehensibility, to inconsistencies between preregis- trations and published papers. To explore ways for addressing these issues, we developed Apéritif, a research prototype that scaffolds the preregistration process and automatically generates analysis code and a methods description. In an evaluation with 17 HCI researchers, we found that Apéritif reduces the effort of prereg- istering a study, facilitates researchers’ workflows, and promotes consistency between research artifacts.",0.0874656862745098,0.2358193208333336,0.4829458250875818,0.4877375898989899,,

It remains unclear whether adoption has increased with growing awareness of preregistration and what challenges to preregistration authors and reviewers perceive. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of CHI proceedings between 2018–2021, finding 32 out of 2,874 papers (1.11%) that included one or more links to a total of 47 preregistrations. The major- ity of these (91.49%, 43/47) were quantitative studies, of which 74.42% (32/47) were reporting on Null-Hypothesis Statistical Test- ing (NHST). Given that the vast majority of CHI publications report on at least one study [52], we conclude that preregistration in the HCI research community remains a rare practice. A content analy- sis of the preregistrations and their corresponding papers revealed two main challenges for the reproducibility of preregistered studies: (1) varying levels of detail and (2) inconsistencies between a prereg- istration and its corresponding paper.

Domain-specific registries exist for clinical trials [64], economics [6], and political science [36]. Furthermore, over 1,100 journals and conferences have implemented the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guideline, a standard addressing open science practices, which include study and analysis preregistra- tion [61]. In contrast to domain-specific registries, AsPredicted [65] offers a domain-general preregistration template, where researchers answer nine questions about their research designs and analyses. The platform subsequently generates a short time-stamped pre- registration PDF. The Open Science Foundation (OSF) [28] offers another domain-general registry, where authors preregister in fields such as social and behavioral science, education, business, and life science. OSF contains nine preregistration templates, including a standard template, a more flexible open-ended template, a qual- itative template, a secondary data template, a registered report protocol template, a pre-data collection template, the template from AsPredicted, a post-completion template, and a preregistration tem- plate in social psychology. Both platforms elicit similar information but ask slightly different questions to guide researchers through the preregistration process (see Table 1 for a list of questions of both templates and supplementary materials for both template inter- faces). Notably, both AsPredicted and OSF provide detailed answer examples for each field. Researchers can also use open registra- tion by posting a customized PDF instead of the form on existing registries [62].",0.0873921568627451,0.5246701656565657,0.48294370227451,0.8957527414141414,,

De- signing a research study typically demands that researchers identify abstract concepts, determine measures, assign different conditions, formulate hypotheses, and decide sample sizes, among other study- specific requirements [40, 90]. These tasks consume considerable time. Preregistration facilitates this process by inviting all research members to reach agreement in a timely manner. For example, a team member can preregister an initial study plan, after which the team can make changes and deliberate until a final agreement is reached. As a result, it encourages collaboration and team science that facilitates complete and high-powered study designs [60].",0.5195343137254902,0.1268557717171717,0.9145744119215687,0.2903840545454545,,

Researchers have argued that it may mitigate HARKing (Hy- pothesizing After Results are Known [46]), a sloppy research prac- tice of post hoc “fishing” for a significant effect after data has been collected [81]. This typically occurs when researchers conduct Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), which relies on a criti- cal 𝑝 -value to assess whether an effect is significant. In response, preregistration timestamps any variables, hypotheses, and analy- sis plans before data collection, mitigating “questionable research practices” [39]. Evidence in clinical trials shows that preregistra- tion reduced the number of studies that rejected null hypotheses from 57% to 8% [42]. As a result, it de-emphasizes a commonly used dichotomous threshold (e.g., 𝑝 < 0 . 05) and reinforces rigor- ous study designs and method planning [94]. Researchers may be more likely to conduct risky but rigorously planned studies that could produce null results [15]. More studies reporting null results increases the likelihood of more publications with non-significant findings; this weakens the “file-drawer effect” [73], whereby stud- ies that do not reach the critical threshold are more likely to be rejected for publication and kept hidden. Because other researchers cannot benefit from seeing such null results, they may be prone to repeating similar dead-end research studies.",0.5195343137254902,0.29289996363636367,0.9145778402509803,0.5947981959595959,,

A recent study of 27 papers with preregistered badges in Psychological Science found that all published studies deviated from the preregistered plans, but only one explained the deviation [13]. Yamada [94] noted that researchers could selectively report data by over-issuing multiple preregistrations or “preregister- ing” after completing an experiment. Instead of solely emphasizing preregistration, some researchers argue that a reputable scientific report should focus on whether an analysis is appropriate given the nature of the data [50, 63, 69, 76].",0.5195343137254902,0.597314105050505,0.9145648887843139,0.7331681454545456,,

For example, qualitative re- searchers may apply thematic or grounded theory analysis for data collected from ethnographic, interview, focus groups, diary or ob- servational studies [4].

In 2018, another SIG on Transparent Statistics Guidelines solicited feedback from the HCI community on a first working draft of the guideline, which included preregistrations [86]. Cockburn et al. raised awareness of preregistration and encouraged HCI researchers to preregister their studies [15]; the authors anticipated a substantial growth of preregistered studies and a consequent reduction in the proportion of significant study results.

We chose NHST as a starting point because the majority of studies in our CHI paper analysis used it, and because it generally remains widely used in HCI [8, 24]. Apéritif currently supports statistical analyses and sample size recommendations based on a limited set of tests in Table 3 under the NHST paradigm, though the HCI community has raised awareness and made efforts to incorporate other meth- ods such as Bayesian analysis [45] and interval estimation [23]. Extending tools like Apéritif to support preregistering other forms of user interface evaluation, such as demonstration, usage, tech- nical benchmarks and heuristics [51], under NHST [19, 40] and non-NHST frameworks [23, 45], will be an important next step.",0.51909477124183,0.1268557717171717,0.9145659436549021,0.31805829696969695,,

Our user study surfaced challenges to adapting Apéritif to qualitative studies with one participant suggesting that it might “hamper the open mind that researchers need for qualitative work.” While qualitative researchers have raised concerns over the push for overarching transparency [38], future work needs to investigate how useful the current preregistration templates are for qualitative studies and explore how to support planning for qualitative studies with scaffolding.",0.5189918300653594,0.3205742060606061,0.9123776860653596,0.45642824646464647,,

After submitting this paper, OSF pushed an update in December 2021 that enabled support for tracking the history of preregistrations and justifying changes, which suggests that version control has been a long-standing need. However, our user study did not thoroughly evaluate the benefits of this feature, how well it integrates with the research process for authors, or how it may be interpreted by reviewers. Future longitudinal studies should qualitatively assess how researchers use this feature as a research project evolves and what consequences may arise from it. For example, it may be necessary to integrate visualizations of a preregistration’s history for optimal support [47], similar to analytic decision graphs [54]. The multiverse analysis concept [24, 55, 79] can also capture alternative analyses and decision making through a large set of reasonable scenarios and could provide inspiration for visualizing version control in preregistrations.",0.5195343137254902,0.4589441555555555,0.914346003137255,0.6916580444444443,,
