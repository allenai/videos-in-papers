Here we describe our design of a simple system, called Minglr, which supports this kind of interaction by facilitating the matching of conversational part- ners. We describe two studies of this system’s use at two virtual conferences with over 450 total participants. Our results provide evidence for the usefulness of this capability, showing that, for example, 81% of people who used the system successfully thought that future virtual conferences should include a tool with similar functionality. We believe that similar functionality is likely to be widely implemented in many videoconferencing systems and to increase the feasibility and desirability of many kinds of remote work and socializing.",0.08736437908496732,0.24814634103535357,0.48294152124183015,0.4862274888888889,,
