As creators can face overwhelming numbers of comments, with some of them harassing or hateful, platforms typically provide tools such as word filters for creators to automate aspects of moderation. From needfinding interviews with 19 creators about how they use existing tools, we found that they struggled with writing good filters as well as organizing and revising their filters, due to the difficulty of determining what the filters actually catch. To address these issues, we present FilterBuddy, a system that supports creators in authoring new filters or building from pre-made ones, as well as organizing their filters and visualizing what comments are captured by them over time. We conducted an early-stage evaluation of FilterBuddy with YouTube creators, finding that participants see FilterBuddy not just as a moderation tool, but also a means to organize their comments to better understand their audiences.",0.09361316872427984,0.25972270761111105,0.9077495360666663,0.4091621242777778,,

Our review of moderation tools across popular social network sites found that word filters are offered by YouTube, Twitter, Facebook Pages, Reddit, Instagram, and Twitch, among others. Word filters are a subset of rule-based moderation tools, or tools that allow end-users to author executable rules over comments to determine what to filter out. Rule-based methods are currently in use by many online communities [54, 60, 106].

P9 noted: “Obviously, something like adding word filters could potentially have a negative impact if 75% of your viewers are saying a phrase that you filtered out.

Each phrase in FilterBuddy is not just an exact-match filter but a regular expression under the hood. We provide two forms of per-phrase settings, including whether matching should be case-sensitive and if it should cover spelling variants (see Figure 2-D). For example, ‘ABCD’ is an acronym that is a South-Asian slur, which, if configured with cases-sensitive setting on, will be caught in comments only where the term occurs with the capitalized case. With the spell variants setting turned on, a phrase will also match plurals and words with characters repeated. For example, configuring ‘shit’ as a phrase would also capture comments containing ‘shiiit’ and ‘shittt’ . In the future, we will investigate more comprehensive approaches to capturing spelling variants while retaining some customizability. By tying these settings to a single phrase, we also increase organization ( G1 ), as typically, users would need to write out every variant as distinct comma-separated keywords. FilterBuddy allows configuring the same phrase as a word filter in more than one category: when a word filter configuration is changed in one category, the same change also reflects for that filter in other categories.",0.09353909465020577,0.3368752353333333,0.9057219228378598,0.5499650131111111,,

This preview also shows whether these comments have not already been caught by another phrase and reports the total number of uncaught comments at the top. We note that this feature may inadvertently expose users to abusive comments they receive. However, by letting users understand the contextual details of how particular keywords are used on their channel, it can help them make more informed decisions on how to automate moderation and see fewer of these comments in the future.

One of our key findings from both our needfinding (Sec. 3.3.3, 3.3.5) and system evaluation (Sec. 5.2.1) is the extent to which content creators value retaining control and having visibility over their moderation operations. As noted earlier, study participants preferred to retain granular control over the actions associated with each configured keyword and to specify whether they want to include spelling variants (Sec. 3.3.2). However, additional control can incur a trade-off with manual effort. Turning on the spelling variants setting has the advantage of reducing the number of separate rules that creators would need to set up for terms with similar meanings. On the other hand, turning this on also reduces visibility into exactly which keywords are currently set up to trigger the configured actions and increases the chance of obtaining false positives. Participants were also wary of catching false positives with greater automation, which made them hesitant to use machine learning (ML) tools to remove inappropriate content (Sec. 5.2.1).

The YouTube API features that we use, including comment retrieval and comment removal, have uneven but grow- ing support across other major platforms. Many of FilterBuddy’s features are also valuable and much needed in other moderation contexts. For example, prior research has shown that volunteer moderation teams on sites like Reddit often struggle with using moderation tools that are difficult to configure and have lack of visibility into the operations of such tools [54]; FilterBuddy offers to address these needs.",0.09429629629629631,0.6025460686666667,0.9091781355407406,0.7326136242222222,,

This entirely text-based approach is insufficient to regulate online communication that is frequently and increasingly multimodal. Thus, it is important to incorporate and build upon prior research on multimodal approaches to hate speech detection in the future [49, 129]. Further, since FilterBuddy is a regular expression-based tool, it is limited in its ability to detect posts that use more subtle or complex linguistic strategies to propagate hate speech. Similarly, it might have limited utility in addressing some forms of undesirable content such as political or health misinformation. Yet, we expect that this tool will introduce friction [14] to successfully posting inappropriate posts and act as a powerful deterrent against bad actors, thereby delimiting their submission of such posts. Prior research has shown that poorly implemented blocklists can disproportionately remove text from and about minority individuals and exacerbate existing inequalities [25, 93, 100].

We suspect that our user study may have introduced some biases, e.g., participants may have overstated their desire for control, which may alter as the creators use our tool in the wild and get overworked; we are excited to see if this calculus changes in a long-term field deployment. Even in our small user study, participants devised a number of use cases for creating FilterBuddy categories that we had not anticipated.

We developed FilterBuddy, a word filter tool that helps content creators better address their moderation needs by offering new visualizations, configuration assistance, and ready-made categories. As opposed to the reactive, too-little-too-late approach primarily used by platforms to decrease online harm, FilterBuddy intercepts potentially problematic posts at an earlier stage of the process, before they have been read by the content creators or their audiences.
